The Abiel Smith School, located at 46 Joy Street, was constructed between 1834 and 1835. It was built by the City of Boston to house the African School and was one of the earliest buildings designed by architect Richard Upjohn. Starting in 1787, many black Bostonians fought tirelessly against the inequality and discrimination in public schools. At that early date, numerous community members, including Prince Hall, petitioned the state legislature claiming that it was unjust for their taxes to support the education of white children when the city had no school for black children. However, a small number of African American children did attend the city’s white schools in the early 1800s. In 1798, sixty members of the black community organized the African School in order to educate their children. This school first met in the home of Primus Hall. It moved into the first floor room of the African Meeting House in 1808. At this date, the African American children who were enrolled in Boston public schools moved their enrollment to the African School. In 1812, the Boston School Committee finally became worn down by decades of petitions and requests; they officially recognized the African School and started providing partial funding ($200 yearly), but the condition of this school remained poor and space was inadequate."	https://africanamericantrailproject.tufts.edu/19th-century-sites

The Asylum was incorporated in 1877 and opened in 1880. The purchase of the Jamaica Plain estate of J. Gardiner Weld, a commercial merchant who died c. 1876 prior to inhabiting his new mansion, was made possible by Seth Adams, who made his fortune at his sugar refinery in South Boston that had begun in 1858. The Adams brothers (Seth and Isaac) previously had manufactured printing presses and machinery. Seth Adams at his death bequeathed $600,000 for establishment of a curative institution for the benefit of indigent, debilitated, nervous people, inhabitants of the State who are not insane."	http://bit.ly/1qg2xSL

The emigrants / boarded vessels so unseaworthy / they were called Coffin Ships. So / many passengers died at sea that / poet John Boyle O’Reilly called the / Atlantic Ocean upon which they / journeyed “a bowl of tears.”(Monument 3) The American dream - Despite hostility from some Boston- / ians and signs of NO IRISH NEED / APPLY, the Famine Irish eventually / transformed themselves from im- / poverished refugees to hard-working, / successful Americans. The leader- / ship of Boston Irish like John Boyle / O’Reilly, Patrick Collins and Richard / Cardinal Cushing culminated in a / descendent of the famine gener- / ation, John F. Kennedy, becoming the / nation’s first Irish Catholic President / in 1960. Today 44 million Americans / claim Irish ancestry, leading the / nation in Medal of Honor winners, / and excelling in literature, sports, / business, medicine, medicine and entertainment.(Monument 4) An Gorta Mor - The great famine which ravaged Ireland / between 1845-50 was the major catastrophe / of the 19th century. It brought horrific suf- / fering and loss to Ireland’s 8.5 million / people. Over one million died of starvation / and disease. Another two million emigrated, / seeking sanctuary in Boston and other / North American cities. Those remaining in / Ireland suffered poverty, eviction, and the / decimation of their culture.

Shaw was the only son of Francis George and Sarah Blake (née Sturgis) Shaw. Robert Gould Shaw was an American officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Born into a prominent Boston abolitionist family, he accepted command of the first all-black regiment in the Northeast. SHaw himself was white. The Shaws were a wealthy and well connected New York and Boston family. They were also radical abolitionists and Unitarians. The Robert Gould Shaw and Massachusetts 54th Regiment Memorial, located across Beacon Street from the State House, serves as a reminder of the heavy cost paid by individuals and families during the Civil War. In particular, it serves as a memorial to the group of men who were among the first African Americans to fight in that war. Although African Americans served in both the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, northern racist sentiments kept African Americans from taking up arms for the United States in the early years of the Civil War. However, a clause in Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation made possible the organization of African American volunteer regiments. The first documented African American regiment formed in the north was the Massachusetts 54th Volunteer Infantry, instituted under Governor John Andrew in 1863. African American men came to enlist from every region of the north, and from as far away as the Caribbean. Robert Gould Shaw was the man Andrew chose to lead this regiment."	https://africanamericantrailproject.tufts.edu/19th-century-sites

From 1768 to 1771, Abigail Adams (1744-1817) lived in two locations in and near Brattle Square with her husband, attorney John Adams, and their family. It was a period of increasing family responsibilities for her. Her five children were born between 1765 and 1772. The family lived there during the Boston Massacre, which took place nearby‚Äîjust outside the Old State House‚Äîin 1770. After John Adams successfully defended the British soldiers involved in the incident, his health declined. The family moved back to their farm in Braintree (now Quincy) the following year, but returned to Boston in 1772. They were in Boston during the Boston Tea Party in 1773, but by 1774 the Adamses had moved back to the farm permanently because John began traveling for the new Republic‚Äîfirst as a delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Abigail Adams became well known as a critical thinker and correspondent with her husband, who was away from the farm for much of the next ten years. She managed the farm, their large family, and their financial affairs. Abigail Adams is one of three women chosen to be portrayed in the Boston Women‚Äôs Memorial.Mercy Otis Warren Among Abigail Adams‚Äôs correspondents was Mercy Otis Warren (1728-1814), probably the first published women historian in the U.S. In 1805, she published a three-volume history of the American Revolution.

In 1974 the Ames Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1993 it was designated a Boston Landmark, a measure the Alliance vocally supported. After purchasing the building in 2007, Normandy Real Estate Partners and Ames Hotel Partners transformed the empty building into one of Boston's newest boutique hotels, currently operated by Morgans Hotel Group.

It was one of many National Guard armories built across the state in the late 1800s, and it bears some resemblance to Springfield’s state armory, which was built around the same time. The Armory of the First Corps of Cadets was built between 1891 and 1897, and like many other prominent civic buildings in late 19th century Boston it was designed by William Gibbons Preston, whose other works included Mechanics Hall and the Museum of Natural History. Although the castle-like building seems somewhat whimsical in appearance, it actually served a very practical purpose; in the event of riots or other civil unrest, it would be able to withstand any attacks.

A mill company's dam's basin became an increasingly noxious open sewer, particularly at low tide. Even then, pollution was a problem, and Bostonians demanded a solution. Enter Frederick Law Olmsted. He proposed to flush out the stagnant waterway and add naturalistic plantings to emulate the original tide marsh ecology of the Fenway area. His plan was true to both the character of the land and the needs of the growing population. Today we find in the Fens different charms from the ones Olmsted created. The 1910 damming of the Charles River changed the water here from brackish to fresh, rendering his plantings unsupportable. Only two of the original ""strong but unobtrusive"" bridges, the parks general boundaries and some early trees remain of Olmsted's design. The Fens continues to be much loved and utilized. Community gardens; the elegant Kellecher Rose Garden; World War II, Korean and Vietnam War memorial; busy ball fields; and the unusual range of bird species are major attractions."	http://bit.ly/OxlNwQ

This population concentration was a result of the black community’s migration from Beacon Hill to Back Bay and the adjoining South End. Many men in these neighborhoods worked as Pullman Porters on interstate trains throughout the Northeast. During the 1910s, these porters organized in protest against discrimination and exploitative pay, which attracted the attention of Harlem activist A. Philip Randolph, who later founded the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP). The Brotherhood was established in 1925 and formally recognized as a union in 1937. In 1986, as part of the state’s Southwest Corridor project, artist Tina Allen was commissioned to design this statue for Back Bay Station to commemorate Randolph and the local black community’s contribution to the BSCP.

It was located on the second floor of an annex to the next-door Adams House hotel. It replaced an earlier theatre in the same building that at various times was called the Lion, the Mechanics Institute, the Melodeon Varieties, the New Melodeon, and the Gaiety. B.F. Keith took over the Bijou Theatre in 1886 and began to stage vaudeville shows there. Later he converted it to show movies and renamed it the Bijou Dream Theatre. At one point it was also called the Intown Theatre. The Bijou Theatre continued operating into the 1940’s, but after the horrific Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire of 1942, Boston enacted stricter fire laws that doomed the Bijou Theatre. Its exits led not to the street but rather to two neighboring theatres, the old BF Keith Theatre (later called the Normandie Theatre and the Laffmovie Theatre) and the newer Keith Memorial Theatre (much later called the Savoy Theatre and the Boston Opera House). Eventually the Bijou Theatre was razed to the orchestra and stage floors, which became the roof of the stores below."	https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/imce-uploads/2019-07/blc_landmarks_petitions_as_of_july_2019_-_chronological.pdf

Under the pediment was set a gorgeous rosette stained glass window,” wrote Heath. The church was built at a cost of $115,000, which included 15 stained-glass windows designed and made by the Boston master glass artisan Charles Connick, according to Heath. Construction of the church finished in 1917. After the church was shut down and sold, 11 windows were moved to the Sacred Heart Church in Weymouth in 2007. The church campus was controversially closed in 2004 and was bought by the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corporation (JPNDC) and New Atlantic Development in 2005. The campus has been redeveloped over the years, including the rectory building being put on wheels to move and become condos.

For more than a century, though, the Boston Fish Pier—the country’s oldest working edifice of its kind—has stood as a reminder of the area’s seagoing past. Begun in 1910 and originally known as Pier 6, Boston Fish Pier was slated to replace the smaller, downtown piers that had been the center of the fishing industry in the Hub. Two years later, two large buildings were constructed along opposite sides of the pier to house fish dealers and other related marine businesses, along with an administration and auction building at the end of the pier. The structure also housed an eight-story cold storage facility, since demolished along with a bygone power plant, that was said to have been the largest in the world. When the Fish Pier made its official debut, it contained berths for 40 fishing vessels, with the capacity to have more than 80 boats unload simultaneously. For much of the 20th century, the fishing business at the pier was booming, peaking in 1963 with a total catch of 339 million pounds."

The city had been suffering from a period of decline during the early- to mid-20th century. However, the Boston Redevelopment Authority, flush with public investment, was hoping to reinvigorate the city’s urban center. Boston City Hall, as well as City Hall Plaza and the rest of Government Center, replaced the run-down neighborhood of Scollay Square.The city went on an international contest to select the design for Boston’s “New City Hall.” After receiving a total of 256 entries, a panel of judges picked the winning design, a collaboration between Gerhard Kallmann, Noel McKinnell and Edward Knowles, in May 1962. Brutalism as a style began to fall out of favor in the 1970s. Experts attribute a variety of potential reasons. Abramson notes that concrete as a material can appear “off-putting,” “overbearing,” and “indecipherable.”"	https://www.boston.com/news/history/2018/07/25/boston-city-hall-brutalism

In 1875, after a drive by the New England Women's Club, six women took their seats on the Boston School Committee elected by Boston men. Although the Committee was reduced from 116 to 24 members the following year, four women were reelected including Lucretia Crocker (1829-86), who later became the first woman supervisor in the Boston Public Schools, and Abby May (1829-88). May succeeded in starting a separate Latin School for girls, but it was not until 1972 that the two Latin schools became co-educational. When May was defeated for reelection, women all over Massachusetts petitioned the legislature and won the right to vote for school board members, starting in 1879.Julia Duff Julia Harrington Duff (1859-1932) of Charlestown, a former Boston School teacher, was the first Irish-American woman to be elected to the Boston School Committee in 1900. Her rallying cry, Boston schools for Boston girls,‚Äù expressed her belief that Yankee teachers from outside the city were being hired in preference to the young Catholic women graduates of Boston's Normal School. Boston women teachers pressed for their rights. Among the women challenging the 1880s School Committee regulation that women resign upon marriage were Grace Lonergan Lorch (1903-74) and Suzanne Revaleon Green. Green's husband, a lawyer, succeeded in having his wife and two other married teachers reinstated to their teaching positions. The regulation remained on the books, however, until 1953 when a state law required its removal."

The area also supported Dress Reform Parlors in the 1880s, where women could be freed from the restrictive fashions of the day. They could purchase or buy patterns for such items as the ‚ emancipation waist."

As a child, Lewis, who had both African American and Chippewa ancestry, lived with her Chippewa mother's people. Although she was born free, her favorite subject for her sculpture was freedom from slavery, demonstrated in Forever Free, a sculpture depicting a man and woman breaking their chains, made as a tribute to abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. It is now on display at the Howard University Gallery of Art. Her most popular work was a bust of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the white commander of the African American 54th Massachusetts Infantry during the Civil War. Lewis's identification with her Chippewa heritage caused her also to revere and create a bust of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, author of the poem, Hiawatha. The sculpture is now owned by the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University."

At age twenty-three she established a business selling imported cloth and dry goods from Great Britain. She proved to be such a resourceful business woman that she soon earned enough money to be entirely self-sufficient‚ a rare achievement for a colonial woman. Although she married three times, Murray remained childless. Still, she oversaw the education and upbringing of her nieces, kindling in them a spirit of self-reliance and self-esteem. She helped them and other needy women set up shops of their own. Murray once wrote to a friend, I'd rather [be] a useful member of society than all of the fine delicate creatures of the age."

Chapman, a founder of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society, was a supporter of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, publisher of the famed abolitionist newspaper The Liberator. An inspired organizer and fundraiser, Chapman ran twenty-two yearly anti-slavery fairs in Boston beginning in 1834. One of her colleagues in this venture was Lydia Maria Child (1802-80) whose 1833 publication, An Appeal in Behalf of that Class of Americans called Africans, was the first book to advocate an immediate end to slavery. Chapman's fairs became a model for women in other parts of the country to raise money for the abolitionist cause. Chapman also published several important anti-slavery tracts including How Can I Help Abolish Slavery? and Right and Wrong in Massachusetts. With Garrison, Maria Chapman supported women's full participation in abolitionist work‚ including public speaking, which had been condemned in a pastoral letter from the Congregational ministers of Massachusetts as being outside women‚Äôs God-ordained sphere. In 1840, Chapman was elected to the executive committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society. Eliza Lee Cabot Follen (1787-1860) was best known for her anti-slavery writings including Anti-Slavery Hymns and Songs and A Letter to Mothers in Free States. In A Letter, Follen wrote, what can women, what can we mothers do? you can do everything; I repeat, you can abolish slavery. Let every mother take the subject to heart, as one in which she has a personal concern. In the silence of the night, let her listen to the slave-mothers crying to her for help. Much of Follen's writing was designed for children, including songs, poems, and stories that carried a moral lesson."

She was born here at #12 Worcester Square on April 10, 1880, from parents recently arrived from Newcastle, Maine. The family moved two years later to Worcester, Massachusetts where Frances was educated in the public schools. As a student at Mount Holyoke College, she witnessed the miserable working conditions of child textile laborers in Holyoke, Massachusetts and vowed to dedicate her career to remedying them.

403	Franklin Place and Home of Judith Sargent Murray	-71.058032	42.3554394										Women's Heritage Trail						"The Tontine Crescent was a fashionable place to live in late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century Boston. The long row of elegant townhouses, designed by Boston architect Charles Bulfinch, was built in 1793 and named Franklin Place after Benjamin Franklin. With the opening of the Back Bay for settlement, they declined in fashion and were demolished in 1872 after the Great Fire. Franklin Street still retains the curve of the buildings. Among the notable women who lived there was Judith Sargent Murray (1751-1820), a native of Gloucester, who moved with her husband, John Murray, to No. 5 Franklin Place in 1794. Judith Sargent Murray was already a successful writer, publishing a regular column (The Gleaner) in the Massachusetts Magazine, a new literary monthly. Using a male persona, Judith expressed her opinions on female equality, education, federalism, and republicanism. She wrote that not only should a woman be educated to be the sensible and informed‚companion of men, but she should also be equipped to earn her own living. Murray saw the many new female academies as inaugurating a new era in female history. In 1798, she published her Gleaner‚ essays in a book she also called The Gleaner, selling it to a list of subscribers including John Adams and George Washington. The Gleaner became a minor classic, and Murray became the first woman in America to self-publish. She was also a poet, publishing in various Boston periodicals under the pen names Honora Martesia and Constantia. An avid letter writer, the copies of letters Murray wrote from 1765-1818 (ages 14-67) were discovered in 1984, and offer a new eyewitness account of early American history. Abby May (1829-88), also an advocate for women‚Äôs rights, lived at 5 Franklin Place with her family as a young woman. Among her many achievements, May succeeded in starting a separate Latin School for girls and served as one of the first women on the Boston School Committee."

A cafeteria provided breakfast, dinner, and box lunches. The Blue Goose restaurant on the main floor was open to the public.<br>Constructed as the St. James Hotel in 1868, the largest in Boston and able to accommodate 500 guests, the building became the New England Conservatory of Music in 1882.

Her twenty-five works of fiction were set both in historical and modern times and dealt with making ethical decisions in different settings. Although she considered herself a ‚Äúnew woman‚Äù determined to preserve her freedom of action, she did not support woman suffrage. Her charity was personal; she took young unwed mothers into her home until they could become self-supporting, believing that their love for their babies would provide an incentive."

Among the Irish women honored by the Boston Women's Heritage Trail is Annie Sullivan Macy (1866-1936), known as the gifted teacher of Helen Keller (1880-1968). Born to poor Irish immigrants to Massachusetts, Sullivan progressively became blind. After the death of her mother and her father's abandonment, she entered an orphanage. In 1880, a supervisor placed her in the Perkins School for the Blind in South Boston. Two operations improved her eyesight enough so she could read, and Sullivan graduated as valedictorian of her class. She became the teacher of Helen Keller, who came from an advantaged family but could not hear, see, or speak. Sullivan devoted her life to Keller, who became a national celebrity, and saw Keller through her education and early career."

A year later, she organized a national conference to form the National Federation of Afro-American Women to show the existence of a ‚Äúlarge and growing class‚Äù of cultured African American women. They met at the Charles Street A.M.E. Church (now Charles Street Meeting House) and merged with the Colored Women‚Äôs League to form the National Association of Colored Women in 1896. Ruffin served as the first vice president. Although it was accepted by the Massachusetts State Federation of Womens‚Äô Clubs, the New Era Club was refused membership in the national federation in 1900 for fear of offending Southern members.<br>Florida Ruffin Ridley (1861-1943), Ruffin‚Äôs daughter, became the second African American teacher in the Boston Public Schools. She was active with her mother in the New Era Club as well as in the League of Women for Community Service. She also became a member of several predominantly white clubs, including the Twentieth Century Club and the Women‚Äôs City Club of Boston. In addition to her work as a club woman and civil rights activist, Ridley was an essayist and journalist, focusing much of her writing on race relations in New England. In the 1920s, her interest in history led her to found the Society of the Descendants of Early New England Negroes. Through this work, she hoped to connect an understanding of history with contemporary work for social justice. African Americans and whites have always been involved, she wrote, ‚Äúin the eternal war for justice and liberty which the state has waged.‚Äù Then, as in her own time, she believed both races deserved an equal place in society."

Although the society continued its mission of providing aid and scholarships to the Arab American community, its mix of ages created an extended family.

As early as 1835, they lived in three locations in the South End, including rooms on Harrison Avenue and Beach Street, before moving to Concord in 1840. By 1848 the family was back, living in a small house on Dedham Street. For a brief time, Louisa assisted her sister Anna B. Alcott (1831-93) who operated a school on Canton Street. In later life, Louisa often spent summers with the family in Concord and winters in Boston; for example, in the winter of 1873 she brought her family to 26 East Brookline Street overlooking Franklin Square. The South End and Concord came together when Louisa rented a quiet room on West Brookline Street for several months in 1868 where she wrote the sequel to Little Women."

In 1957, early followers of the Nation of Islam’s Elijah Muhammad established Mosque No. 11 in an old Synagogue on Intervale Street in Dorchester. Malcolm X, who lived in Roxbury with his sister after his release from prison, ministered at Mosque No. 11 and considered it his home. Louis Farrakhan also ministered at the mosque and lived in the adjoining property, 37 Intervale Street. After X’s assassination in 1965, the Mosque, like others across the country, entered a period of transformation. This was in large part due to the fact that in 1976, when Nation of Islam founder, Elijah Muhammad, passed away, his son, Imam Warith Deen Mohammed, declared that all Nation of Islam followers should convert to Al-Islam. Mosque No. 11 made this conversion, and subsequent leaders, including Imam Shakir Mahmoud, renamed the Mosque Masjid Al-Quran. Presently, Mosque 11 Masjid Al-Quran keeps its doors open to the community of 70,000 Muslims who live and worship in Boston, and members come from all over the city."	https://africanamericantrailproject.tufts.edu/20th-century-sites

The change was prompted by the actions of Benjamin Roberts, an African American, who sued the city in 1848 stating that his daughter Sarah Roberts was unlawfully refused entrance to five schools between her home and the Smith School. Although Roberts lost his case despite the help of prominent abolitionists, his actions had the long term effect of opening all Boston Public Schools to African American children."

They called the nurses ‚'Angels of Mercy and Life Amid Scenes of Conflict and Death'. On the facing balcony wall is a painting honoring mothers of war by Boston artist Edward Brodney. His mother, Sarah Brodney, was the model for the central figure.Two plaques behind the nurse's statue honor two individual wartime nurses: Clara Barton (1821-1912) and Second Lt. Frances Slanger (1913-44). Born in North Oxford, Massachusetts, Clara Barton is best known as the founder of the American Red Cross in 1881. During the Civil War, she administered so much direct aid and provided so many supplies that she became known as the 'Angel of the Battlefield'. She established the first office to coordinate information on missing soldiers. Under her leadership from 1881-1904, the Red Cross provided relief in twenty-one disasters in addition to the Spanish-American War.Frances Slanger was the first American nurse in the European Theater to be killed in combat during World War II. A U.S. Army nurse with the 45th field hospital, she landed in Normandy with the first hospital platoon on June 9, 1944. She is also remembered for the eloquence of a letter she wrote to the Stars and Stripes the day before she died praising the rank and file American GI. At age seven, Slanger emigrated with her family to the U.S. from Lodz, Poland. They settled in the South End where she worked with her father peddling fruits and vegetables while attending school. She graduated from Boston's High School of Practical Arts and the Boston City Hospital School of Nursing."

Phillis Wheatley (ca. 1753-84), the first African American poet to be published in book form, was a member of Old South. While still a child, she was purchased as a slave by the Wheatley family. Her poetry reflects her love of freedom: Should you, wonder from whence my love of Freedom sprung‚ young in life, was snatched from Africa's fancy‚ happy seat‚ such, such my case. And can I then but pray Others may never feel tyrannic sway? Phillis Wheatley is one of three women chosen to be portrayed in the Boston Women's Memorial.

The Anti-Slavery Bazaars, sponsored by the Female Anti-Slavery Societies, were held there in the 1830s and 1840s. In September 1840, women held a seven-day fair to raise money to complete the building of the Bunker Hill monument. Inspired by Sarah Josepha Hale (1820-79), the women raised $30,000. Among the women‚Äôs suffrage meetings held in Faneuil Hall was a New England Woman‚Äôs Tea Party, sponsored on the centennial of the Boston Tea Party by the New England Woman Suffrage Association. They invited the public to join them in the celebration, noting that women were still subject to ‚Äútaxation without representation.‚Äù In an alcove behind the stage, note the bust of Lucy Stone, a main speaker at the Tea Party. Suzette LaFlesheSuzette ‚ÄúBright Eyes‚Äù LaFleshe (1854-1903), an Omaha Indian, inspired the Indian Rights Movement when she spoke in Faneuil Hall in December 1879. LaFlesche, wearing native dress and a bear-claw necklace, protested the reservation system: ‚ÄúDid our Creator‚Ä¶intend that men created in his own image should be ruled over by another set of his creatures?‚Äù After hearing Bright Eyes speak in Boston, many Boston women became her supporters. Helen Hunt Jackson (1830-85) was inspired by her speech to write A Century of Dishonor, a book that cited injustices to the Indian peoples, and works of fiction about Native Americans including Ramona. Working women saw Faneuil Hall as a place for a forum for their demands. In 1903, the Women‚Äôs Trade Union League was founded in Faneuil Hall. Massachusetts nurses also chose the hall to rally for professional status in 1903 when they founded the Massachusetts Nurses Association. Among the organizers was Lucy Lincoln Drown (1847-1934), superintendent of nurses at Boston City Hospital from 1885 to 1910. In 1919, the call for the women telephone operators‚Äô strike brought two thousand angry women to the hall."

When the Normal School moved to the Rice School, women were required to be high school graduates and the course was one year, becoming two years in 1892. Women assistants taught in the two training schools: a boys‚Äô grammar school in the Rice School and a mixed primary school, the Appleton Street School (later the Bancroft School). By the time Boston Normal was renamed Boston Teachers College in 1922, it had its own building on Huntington Avenue and, in 1925, a four-year program.

During the late 1960s and 1970s, due in part to Boston Banks Urban Renewal Group (B-BURG), redlining and blockbusting led to white flight from the area. Mattapan’s black community grew during the 1970s, and since the 1980s, Mattapan has been home to an increasingly ethnically diverse black community, including especially immigrants from Haiti and the Caribbean. This 2005 sculpture, designed by former Mattapan residents and cousins Fern Cunningham and Karen Eutemey, serves as a gateway to Mattapan.

Rowson arrived in America when she was six, but her father was a Loyalist and during the Revolution they returned to England. Not long after her marriage to William Rowson, Susanna returned to America and settled in Boston where they both acted at the Federal Street Theatre. For the five years following 1796, she performed 129 different parts in 126 productions, many of which she wrote herself. Her next venture was to set up a Young Ladies Academy in 1797 near the Theatre. Rowson moved the school out of Boston but later returned. Her academy was one of the first to offer girls education above the elementary level and included instruction in music and public speaking.Another woman playwright whose plays were performed at the Federal Street Theatre in 1795 and 1796 was Judith Sargent Murray. Her satirical plays, The Medium or Happy Tea-Party (later renamed The Medium, or Virtue Triumphant) and The Traveller Returned, addressed class structure and gender roles in the New Republic.Public speakers lecturing at the Federal Street Theatre included Deborah Sampson (1760-1827), considered to be America's first female soldier. In 1802, Sampson electrified the crowd as she told her story of fighting in the Revolutionary War for eighteen months disguised as a man named Robert Shurtleff."

The Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) planned to transform a lot that had been cleared by the city into a parking garage; as many as 100 families were displaced in the initial clearing and there was still great need for affordable housing in the working-class, predominantly black neighborhood. The Tent City occupation attracted support from activists and celebrities, including Celtics player and coach, Bill Russell, who fed the activists as they set up small tents on the lot. Despite multiple arrests, organizers formed the Tent City Task Force (later named the Tent City Corporation), which eventually forced the city to create the Tent City Housing Complex in 1988. Presently, the Tent City Housing Complex is a mixed income development."	https://africanamericantrailproject.tufts.edu/20th-century-sites

Before they built the synagogue, the congregation of Lithuanian Jews worshipped in temporary spaces for nearly twenty-five years. They named the synagogue for the city of Vilnius, because they considered it to be the center of Jewish culture in Lithuania. Many of the original members of the congregation emigrated from Vilnius where there was a large and thriving Jewish community. Only a few decades later it was destroyed by the Holocaust.The names of the women who were among the founding members of the synagogue are listed in a plaque in the back of the sanctuary. Although the entire congregation sat on the same level, the women‚Äôs section was separate from the men‚Äôs section but equal in size (which was typical of synagogues of that time).
