            "Comments": "In 1815 white businessman Abiel Smith died and bequeathed $4,000 for the education of African American children in Boston. The Abiel Smith School, located at 46 Joy Street, was constructed between 1834 and 1835. It was built by the City of Boston to house the African School and was one of the earliest buildings designed by architect Richard Upjohn. Starting in 1787, many black Bostonians fought tirelessly against the inequality and discrimination in public schools. At that early date, numerous community members, including Prince Hall, petitioned the state legislature claiming that it was unjust for their taxes to support the education of white children when the city had no school for black children. However, a small number of African American children did attend the city’s white schools in the early 1800s. In 1798, sixty members of the black community organized the African School in order to educate their children. This school first met in the home of Primus Hall. It moved into the first floor room of the African Meeting House in 1808. At this date, the African American children who were enrolled in Boston public schools moved their enrollment to the African School. In 1812, the Boston School Committee finally became worn down by decades of petitions and requests; they officially recognized the African School and started providing partial funding ($200 yearly), but the condition of this school remained poor and space was inadequate.",

            "Comments": "The historical significance of the property lies chiefly in its development as a medical treatment center that embodied progressive ideals and methods. The Asylum was incorporated in 1877 and opened in 1880. The purchase of the Jamaica Plain estate of J. Gardiner Weld, a commercial merchant who died c. 1876 prior to inhabiting his new mansion, was made possible by Seth Adams, who made his fortune at his sugar refinery in South Boston that had begun in 1858. The Adams brothers (Seth and Isaac) previously had manufactured printing presses and machinery. Seth Adams at his death bequeathed $600,000 for establishment of a curative institution for the benefit of indigent, debilitated, nervous people, inhabitants of the State who are not insane.",

            "Comments": "The statue of Robert Burns and his faithful dog, Luath, was created by sculptor Henry Hudson Kitson in 1920 and originally situated in the Back Bay Fens near sculptor Daniel Chester French’s monument to Irish poet John Boyle O’Reilly. The juxtaposition of the two works was deliberate and meant to recognize Scottish and Irish literary tradition in a pastoral setting reminiscent of their work. The sculpture was moved to Winthrop Square in 1975 and after a prolonged community effort was finally returned to its rightful place in the Fens on October 30, 2019.

Kennedy, becoming the / nation’s first Irish Catholic President / in 1960. Today 44 million Americans / claim Irish ancestry, leading the / nation in Medal of Honor winners, / and excelling in literature, sports, / business, medicine, medicine and entertainment.(Monument 4) An Gorta Mor - The great famine which ravaged Ireland / between 1845-50 was the major catastrophe / of the 19th century. It brought horrific suf- / fering and loss to Ireland’s 8.5 million / people. Over one million died of starvation / and disease. Another two million emigrated, / seeking sanctuary in Boston and other / North American cities. Those remaining in / Ireland suffered poverty, eviction, and the / decimation of their culture. This memorial / remembers the famine, known in Irish as An Gorta Mór (The Great Hunger). It depicts / the Irish exodus from their homeland, their / arrival in Boston and ultimate triumph over / adversity in America. It was dedicated on / June 28, 1998, as part of the 150th anni- / versary of The Great Hunger.",

            "Comments": "The statue, a bronze-based figure carved to look as though Poe is rushing down Boylston Street at the intersection of Charles Street South, a small section of the city that was dubbed “Edgar Allan Poe Square” by former Mayor Tom Menino’s administration, was created by artist Stefanie Rocknak, and is flanked by bits of paper falling from the author’s briefcase. Flying next to Poe is a giant raven, bursting from his baggage. A heart, representing his well-known work The Tell-Tale Heart, is plopped on a pile of books behind Poe’s flowing coat.

He studied theology in Newport and at Harvard and soon became a successful preacher in various churches in the Boston area. From June 1, 1803, until his death he was minister of the Federal Street Church, Boston. Someone adorned the statue of William Ellery Channing with a pink knit hat and scarf when tens of thousands of protesters rallied on Boston Common January 20, 2017 as part of the Women’s March for America, a reaction to the new presidency of Donald Trump.

The original flagpole was located near the corner of Boylston Street and Arlington Street; and the replacement placed there as well. However, after commissioning this replacement, the city deemed the original site too congested and opted for a quieter corner of the garden. The flagpole was moved to its present location in 1933.",

They recommended that a new work of art be created to honor the contributions of women to public life in Massachusetts. Now permanently installed on a large wall just outside Doric Hall, the work depicts six women selected by an advisory committee. Dorothea Dix (1802-87); Lucy Stone (1818-93); Sarah Parker Remond (1814-94); Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin (1842-1924); Mary Kenney O'Sullivan (1864-1943); and Florence Luscomb (1887-1985) were chosen to represent all the women who dedicated themselves to improving life in the Commonwealth. The two-toned marble panels designed by artists Sheila Levrant de Bretteville and Susan Sellers include words written by the women etched on the stone and bronze busts cast from period photographs.",

            "Comments": "Robert G. Shaw was the only son of Francis George and Sarah Blake (née Sturgis) Shaw. Robert Gould Shaw was an American officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Born into a prominent Boston abolitionist family, he accepted command of the first all-black regiment in the Northeast. SHaw himself was white. The Shaws were a wealthy and well connected New York and Boston family. They were also radical abolitionists and Unitarians. The Robert Gould Shaw and Massachusetts 54th Regiment Memorial, located across Beacon Street from the State House, serves as a reminder of the heavy cost paid by individuals and families during the Civil War. In particular, it serves as a memorial to the group of men who were among the first African Americans to fight in that war. Although African Americans served in both the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, northern racist sentiments kept African Americans from taking up arms for the United States in the early years of the Civil War. However, a clause in Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation made possible the organization of African American volunteer regiments. The first documented African American regiment formed in the north was the Massachusetts 54th Volunteer Infantry, instituted under Governor John Andrew in 1863. African American men came to enlist from every region of the north, and from as far away as the Caribbean. Robert Gould Shaw was the man Andrew chose to lead this regiment.",

            "Comments": "The Boston City Hall Plaza covers the same ground as the eighteenth century Brattle Square. From 1768 to 1771, Abigail Adams (1744-1817) lived in two locations in and near Brattle Square with her husband, attorney John Adams, and their family. It was a period of increasing family responsibilities for her. Her five children were born between 1765 and 1772. The family lived there during the Boston Massacre, which took place nearby‚Äîjust outside the Old State House‚Äîin 1770. After John Adams successfully defended the British soldiers involved in the incident, his health declined. The family moved back to their farm in Braintree (now Quincy) the following year, but returned to Boston in 1772. They were in Boston during the Boston Tea Party in 1773, but by 1774 the Adamses had moved back to the farm permanently because John began traveling for the new Republic‚Äîfirst as a delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Abigail Adams became well known as a critical thinker and correspondent with her husband, who was away from the farm for much of the next ten years. She managed the farm, their large family, and their financial affairs. Abigail Adams is one of three women chosen to be portrayed in the Boston Women‚Äôs Memorial.Mercy Otis Warren Among Abigail Adams‚Äôs correspondents was Mercy Otis Warren (1728-1814), probably the first published women historian in the U.S. In 1805, she published a three-volume history of the American Revolution. She also published several satirical plays.",

            "Comments": "Built in 1890, the Ames Building was designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge and stood as Boston’s tallest building at the time. Upon its completion, the building became a prominent office location in Boston's growing financial district and its height offered Bostonians a unique vantage point of the city, the roof being a popular tourist attraction. Creating a building style unique to its time, the structure blended Romanesque and Byzantine architectural styles and incorporated a masonry façade of blue slate and red sandstone details along with decorative carvings. In 1974 the Ames Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1993 it was designated a Boston Landmark, a measure the Alliance vocally supported. After purchasing the building in 2007, Normandy Real Estate Partners and Ames Hotel Partners transformed the empty building into one of Boston's newest boutique hotels, currently operated by Morgans Hotel Group. Respecting the historic character of the building, the project included skillful restoration of the exterior masonry façade, window surrounds and moldings, and careful restoration of the lobby's vaulted mosaic-tiled ceiling",

            "Comments": "In 1932, Anna Bobbitt Gardner (1901-97) became the first African American women to be awarded a bachelor‚Äôs degree from the New England Conservatory of Music. She operated at least five studios in Boston under the same name for more than sixty years. She first opened the Academy in 1924 in the basement of her home. She managed Colored American Nights, featuring African American musicians at Symphony Hall, and produced local radio and television programs for an African American audience. In 1945, Gov. Maurice J. Tobin appointed her state director of Negro History Week programs to accompany fine arts exhibits at selected historic buildings. Succeeding governors reappointed her to the position. Since 1997, the New England Conservatory has granted a musician the Anna Bobbitt Gardner Lifetime Achievement Award.",

            "Comments": "Anne Hutchinson (1591-1643) was banished from Boston in the first decade of settlement because her religious views were different from those of the ruling ministers. Believing that both men and women could receive grace only from God, she accused the ministers of preaching that good works signified holiness. Hutchinson attracted women to prayer meetings she held in her home in part because her beliefs put women's souls on an equal footing with men's souls. She was a respected midwife and wife of an established merchant, but was banished in 1638 for heresy (see also D19). This statue, erected in 1922 as a gift of the Anne Hutchinson Memorial Association and the State Federation of Women‚Äôs Clubs, was sculpted by Cyrus E. Dallin.",

Fields was also active in charitable works. She spent many hours at the Charity House on Chardon Street and cofounded the Cooperative Society of Visitors, a case review agency that made recommendations to the central administration of Boston‚Äôs relief organizations for aid disbursement. The Society was absorbed into the Associated Charities of Boston. Fields‚Äôs book How to Help the Poor (1884) served as an unofficial guide to the programs and policies of Associated Charities.",

Because of the era‚Äôs 13% rate of school absenteeism, the Boston School Committee in 1905, in an experimental and privately funded program with the Instructive District Nurse Association, appointed Annie McKay, a trained nurse, to supplement the work of physicians. She was assigned three schools in the South End: the Quincy, Way Street and Andrews. This program, judged an overwhelming success in improving student health and attendance moved the state to pass legislation in 1907 mandating school health services throughout Massachusetts.

            "Comments": "Mixed in with modern high-rise buildings, this building looks more like it belongs in medieval Europe than in Boston, but it once served an important role in the city’s history. It was one of many National Guard armories built across the state in the late 1800s, and it bears some resemblance to Springfield’s state armory, which was built around the same time. The Armory of the First Corps of Cadets was built between 1891 and 1897, and like many other prominent civic buildings in late 19th century Boston it was designed by William Gibbons Preston, whose other works included Mechanics Hall and the Museum of Natural History. Although the castle-like building seems somewhat whimsical in appearance, it actually served a very practical purpose; in the event of riots or other civil unrest, it would be able to withstand any attacks. The tower could even be used to exchange signals with officials at the Massachusetts State House, which is located on the other side of Boston Common.",

It is one of the oldest commercial buildings extant in downtown Charlestown, and it housed the first office of Charlestown's first regular newspaper, the Bunker Hill Aurora. Furthermore, it was built and occupied by one of Charlestown's early and prominant families. The Austin Block building was erected by 1827 when the Bunker Hill Aurora began printing its earliest editions from their upper floor quarters. Early occupants of the building, according to the first Charlestown directory, published in 1831, (and giving the original address of 85 Main Street), were George Johnson's West Indian goods store on the first floor, and upstairs, the Bunker Hill Aurora office, plus offices for several members of the Austin family. General Nathaniel Austin, Sheriff of Middlesex County, had his office and living quarters here at that time.",

            "Comments": "As quickly as the Back Bay developed, another problem festered. A mill company's dam's basin became an increasingly noxious open sewer, particularly at low tide. Even then, pollution was a problem, and Bostonians demanded a solution. Enter Frederick Law Olmsted. He proposed to flush out the stagnant waterway and add naturalistic plantings to emulate the original tide marsh ecology of the Fenway area. His plan was true to both the character of the land and the needs of the growing population. Today we find in the Fens different charms from the ones Olmsted created. The 1910 damming of the Charles River changed the water here from brackish to fresh, rendering his plantings unsupportable. Only two of the original \"strong but unobtrusive\" bridges, the parks general boundaries and some early trees remain of Olmsted's design. The Fens continues to be much loved and utilized. Community gardens; the elegant Kellecher Rose Garden; World War II, Korean and Vietnam War memorial; busy ball fields; and the unusual range of bird species are major attractions.",

            "Comments": "When Back Bay Station opened in 1899, African Americans represented nearly a third of the population surrounding Columbus Avenue and Dartmouth Street on the Albany Railroad. This population concentration was a result of the black community’s migration from Beacon Hill to Back Bay and the adjoining South End. Many men in these neighborhoods worked as Pullman Porters on interstate trains throughout the Northeast. During the 1910s, these porters organized in protest against discrimination and exploitative pay, which attracted the attention of Harlem activist A. Philip Randolph, who later founded the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP). The Brotherhood was established in 1925 and formally recognized as a union in 1937. In 1986, as part of the state’s Southwest Corridor project, artist Tina Allen was commissioned to design this statue for Back Bay Station to commemorate Randolph and the local black community’s contribution to the BSCP. The station concluded renovations in 1987.",

Over a century later, the building is still in good condition, with even the original 1905 storefronts still intact.",

It was located on the second floor of an annex to the next-door Adams House hotel. It replaced an earlier theatre in the same building that at various times was called the Lion, the Mechanics Institute, the Melodeon Varieties, the New Melodeon, and the Gaiety. B.F. Keith took over the Bijou Theatre in 1886 and began to stage vaudeville shows there. Later he converted it to show movies and renamed it the Bijou Dream Theatre. At one point it was also called the Intown Theatre. The Bijou Theatre continued operating into the 1940’s, but after the horrific Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire of 1942, Boston enacted stricter fire laws that doomed the Bijou Theatre. Its exits led not to the street but rather to two neighboring theatres, the old BF Keith Theatre (later called the Normandie Theatre and the Laffmovie Theatre) and the newer Keith Memorial Theatre (much later called the Savoy Theatre and the Boston Opera House). Eventually the Bijou Theatre was razed to the orchestra and stage floors, which became the roof of the stores below.",

Under the pediment was set a gorgeous rosette stained glass window,” wrote Heath. The church was built at a cost of $115,000, which included 15 stained-glass windows designed and made by the Boston master glass artisan Charles Connick, according to Heath. Construction of the church finished in 1917. After the church was shut down and sold, 11 windows were moved to the Sacred Heart Church in Weymouth in 2007. The church campus was controversially closed in 2004 and was bought by the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corporation (JPNDC) and New Atlantic Development in 2005. The campus has been redeveloped over the years, including the rectory building being put on wheels to move and become condos. The convent became housing and the Norbert School has plans to become 21 apartment units. A mixed-use building was also built at the corner of Creighton and Centre Streets.",

For more than a century, though, the Boston Fish Pier—the country’s oldest working edifice of its kind—has stood as a reminder of the area’s seagoing past. Begun in 1910 and originally known as Pier 6, Boston Fish Pier was slated to replace the smaller, downtown piers that had been the center of the fishing industry in the Hub. Two years later, two large buildings were constructed along opposite sides of the pier to house fish dealers and other related marine businesses, along with an administration and auction building at the end of the pier. The structure also housed an eight-story cold storage facility, since demolished along with a bygone power plant, that was said to have been the largest in the world. When the Fish Pier made its official debut, it contained berths for 40 fishing vessels, with the capacity to have more than 80 boats unload simultaneously. For much of the 20th century, the fishing business at the pier was booming, peaking in 1963 with a total catch of 339 million pounds.",

            "Comments": "City Hall is just one — though perhaps the most notable — example in a wave of major brutalist buildings constructed in Boston in the 1960s. The city had been suffering from a period of decline during the early- to mid-20th century. However, the Boston Redevelopment Authority, flush with public investment, was hoping to reinvigorate the city’s urban center. Boston City Hall, as well as City Hall Plaza and the rest of Government Center, replaced the run-down neighborhood of Scollay Square.The city went on an international contest to select the design for Boston’s “New City Hall.” After receiving a total of 256 entries, a panel of judges picked the winning design, a collaboration between Gerhard Kallmann, Noel McKinnell and Edward Knowles, in May 1962. Brutalism as a style began to fall out of favor in the 1970s. Experts attribute a variety of potential reasons. Abramson notes that concrete as a material can appear “off-putting,” “overbearing,” and “indecipherable.”",

            "Comments": "Women were elected to the Boston School Committee before they could vote. In 1875, after a drive by the New England Women's Club, six women took their seats on the Boston School Committee elected by Boston men. Although the Committee was reduced from 116 to 24 members the following year, four women were reelected including Lucretia Crocker (1829-86), who later became the first woman supervisor in the Boston Public Schools, and Abby May (1829-88). May succeeded in starting a separate Latin School for girls, but it was not until 1972 that the two Latin schools became co-educational. When May was defeated for reelection, women all over Massachusetts petitioned the legislature and won the right to vote for school board members, starting in 1879.Julia Duff Julia Harrington Duff (1859-1932) of Charlestown, a former Boston School teacher, was the first Irish-American woman to be elected to the Boston School Committee in 1900. Her rallying cry, Boston schools for Boston girls,‚Äù expressed her belief that Yankee teachers from outside the city were being hired in preference to the young Catholic women graduates of Boston's Normal School. Boston women teachers pressed for their rights. Among the women challenging the 1880s School Committee regulation that women resign upon marriage were Grace Lonergan Lorch (1903-74) and Suzanne Revaleon Green. Green's husband, a lawyer, succeeded in having his wife and two other married teachers reinstated to their teaching positions. The regulation remained on the books, however, until 1953 when a state law required its removal.",

            "Comments": "During the American Revolution, people of African and Native descent fought on both sides of the conflict. Although Colonel George Washington initially prevented African descended people from serving in the Continental Army, many black men across New England joined local military companies that rallied in support of the Revolution. Some of these men were no doubt familiar with Buckman Tavern (est. 1709 - 1710), the first public house in Lexington, and a favorite gathering place for militia men during their training on the nearby Lexington Green. In 1773, an enslaved man, Prince Estabrook (c. 1741 - 1830) enlisted in the Lexington militia. Estabrook fought alongside his fellow colonists at the famous Battle of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Estabrook's story is memorialized on a plaque outside the tavern.",

After the Civil War, the Church moved to Charles Street at the base of Beacon Hill, where it continued its important role in African-American history. During the 1890s, for instance, local black feminist and equal rights activist, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin (1842 - 1924) founded the National Federation of Afro-American Women in the Charles Street Church. In 1939, the church moved to Roxbury, where it remains today a vibrant institution within Boston’s African American community.",

            "Comments": "Before the widening of Massachusetts Avenue in the 1950s, Chester Square was an elegant park surrounded by a wrought iron fence and centered with a fountain. Among the notable women living there with their families was writer Anna Cabot Lowell Quincy Waterston (1812‚Äì99), whose witty 1833 diary has recently been republished. She was a minister‚Äôs wife and the daughter of Boston Mayor Josiah Quincy. Archeologist Harriet Boyd Hawes (1871‚Äì1945) was born and spent her childhood on Chester Square. After training at Smith College and joining excavations in Crete, she became the first woman to lead an archaeological expedition when she discovered the ancient town of Gournia on Crete. In later years she also served as a volunteer nurse during the Greco-Turkish War and World War I.<br>The South End Historical Society has worked to preserve the history and restore the buildings of the South End. The Society purchased 532 Massachusetts Avenue in the 1970s and occupies the parlor on the second floor which still has many original features. Architect Luther Briggs Jr. designed the building in 1860 for Francis and Zervia Dane. Realtor Betty Gibson also helped revitalize the South End. In the 1960s she moved to 530 Massachusetts Avenue to demonstrate her commitment to the area‚Äôs renewal.",

            "Comments": "David Walker (c. 1796 - 1830) was one of the most radical black abolitionists of his time, publishing his “Appeal” (1829) as a rallying cry for enslaved resistance, free black community organization, and an immediate end to slavery. Born free in Wilmington, North Carolina, Walker moved to Boston around 1825, opened a used clothing shop, and resided in the heart of black abolitionist Boston at this site, then known as 4 Belknap Street. Although Walker lived here only briefly (1827 - 1829), he supported black-led abolition in Boston until his death in 1830, including the Massachusetts General Colored Association (predecessor to William Lloyd Garrison’s New England Anti-Slavery Society), and the early black feminism of fellow abolitionist, Maria Stewart (1803 - 1879). Stewart - the first woman in the United States to deliver a public speech on a political subject - resided here after Walker’s death, during the early 1830s.",

            "Comments": "The short streets running between Tremont and Washington Streets‚ including Hamilton Place, Winter Street, and Temple Place‚ contained shops for women in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Many women were successful proprietors of dressmaking and millinery shops, including Irish-born Ellen Hartnett, who rose from being a millinery worker in 1860 to a shop owner with capital twenty-five years later. In order to secure the best class of customers, some dressmakers, like Josephine McCluskey, took on new names‚ she became ‚'Miss Delavenue'. The area also supported Dress Reform Parlors in the 1880s, where women could be freed from the restrictive fashions of the day. They could purchase or buy patterns for such items as the ‚ emancipation waist.",

            "Comments": "The studio of Edmonia Lewis (1845-ca. 1909), a member of the colony of women sculptors in Rome gathering around Charlotte Cushman (1816-76) in the mid-nineteenth century, was located in a former building at this site from 1863-65. As a child, Lewis, who had both African American and Chippewa ancestry, lived with her Chippewa mother's people. Although she was born free, her favorite subject for her sculpture was freedom from slavery, demonstrated in Forever Free, a sculpture depicting a man and woman breaking their chains, made as a tribute to abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. It is now on display at the Howard University Gallery of Art. Her most popular work was a bust of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the white commander of the African American 54th Massachusetts Infantry during the Civil War. Lewis's identification with her Chippewa heritage caused her also to revere and create a bust of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, author of the poem, Hiawatha. The sculpture is now owned by the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University.",

She proved to be such a resourceful business woman that she soon earned enough money to be entirely self-sufficient‚ a rare achievement for a colonial woman. Although she married three times, Murray remained childless. Still, she oversaw the education and upbringing of her nieces, kindling in them a spirit of self-reliance and self-esteem. She helped them and other needy women set up shops of their own. Murray once wrote to a friend, I'd rather [be] a useful member of society than all of the fine delicate creatures of the age.",

            "Comments": "After the Civil War, as migrants of African descent from the American South, the Caribbean, and Canada arrived in Boston, the community shifted from its antebellum location on Beacon Hill to the South End and lower Roxbury. In 1901, when the elevated streetcar opened in Dudley Square, the area became a hub of commercial, cultural, and political activity in the racially mixed, yet increasingly black, section of Roxbury. The 1995 mural, “Faces of Dudley,” was painted by Mike Womble and a group of teen artists, and was rehabbed by Womble in 2015. In addition to images of renowned residents such as Malcolm X (1925-1965) and Melnea Cass (1896-1978), every other portrait in the mural is a portrait of a neighborhood resident.",

            "Comments": "Among the more well-known Boston women who attended William Ellery Channing's Federal Street Church were abolitionists Maria Weston Chapman (1806-85) and Eliza Lee Cabot Follen. Chapman, a founder of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society, was a supporter of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, publisher of the famed abolitionist newspaper The Liberator. An inspired organizer and fundraiser, Chapman ran twenty-two yearly anti-slavery fairs in Boston beginning in 1834. One of her colleagues in this venture was Lydia Maria Child (1802-80) whose 1833 publication, An Appeal in Behalf of that Class of Americans called Africans, was the first book to advocate an immediate end to slavery. Chapman's fairs became a model for women in other parts of the country to raise money for the abolitionist cause. Chapman also published several important anti-slavery tracts including How Can I Help Abolish Slavery? and Right and Wrong in Massachusetts. With Garrison, Maria Chapman supported women's full participation in abolitionist work‚ including public speaking, which had been condemned in a pastoral letter from the Congregational ministers of Massachusetts as being outside women‚Äôs God-ordained sphere. In 1840, Chapman was elected to the executive committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society. Eliza Lee Cabot Follen (1787-1860) was best known for her anti-slavery writings including Anti-Slavery Hymns and Songs and A Letter to Mothers in Free States. In A Letter, Follen wrote, what can women, what can we mothers do? you can do everything; I repeat, you can abolish slavery. Let every mother take the subject to heart, as one in which she has a personal concern. In the silence of the night, let her listen to the slave-mothers crying to her for help. Much of Follen's writing was designed for children, including songs, poems, and stories that carried a moral lesson.",

As U.S. Secretary of Labor 1933-45, she was the first woman to serve in a presidential cabinet, and the driving force behind Social Security and other programs that still provide financial security for all Americans. She was born here at #12 Worcester Square on April 10, 1880, from parents recently arrived from Newcastle, Maine. The family moved two years later to Worcester, Massachusetts where Frances was educated in the public schools. As a student at Mount Holyoke College, she witnessed the miserable working conditions of child textile laborers in Holyoke, Massachusetts and vowed to dedicate her career to remedying them. She later worked for women‚Äôs suffrage, as a social worker and factory investigator, and was NY State Labor Commissioner, where she successfully lobbied for groundbreaking legislation establishing worker protections. She served throughout the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, later as a U.S. Civil Service Commissioner, and taught at Cornell University for the last ten years of her life.",

            "Comments": "The Tontine Crescent was a fashionable place to live in late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century Boston. The long row of elegant townhouses, designed by Boston architect Charles Bulfinch, was built in 1793 and named Franklin Place after Benjamin Franklin. With the opening of the Back Bay for settlement, they declined in fashion and were demolished in 1872 after the Great Fire. Franklin Street still retains the curve of the buildings. Among the notable women who lived there was Judith Sargent Murray (1751-1820), a native of Gloucester, who moved with her husband, John Murray, to No. 5 Franklin Place in 1794. Judith Sargent Murray was already a successful writer, publishing a regular column (The Gleaner) in the Massachusetts Magazine, a new literary monthly. Using a male persona, Judith expressed her opinions on female equality, education, federalism, and republicanism. She wrote that not only should a woman be educated to be the sensible and informed‚companion of men, but she should also be equipped to earn her own living. Murray saw the many new female academies as inaugurating a new era in female history. In 1798, she published her Gleaner‚ essays in a book she also called The Gleaner, selling it to a list of subscribers including John Adams and George Washington. The Gleaner became a minor classic, and Murray became the first woman in America to self-publish. She was also a poet, publishing in various Boston periodicals under the pen names Honora Martesia and Constantia. An avid letter writer, the copies of letters Murray wrote from 1765-1818 (ages 14-67) were discovered in 1984, and offer a new eyewitness account of early American history. Abby May (1829-88), also an advocate for women‚Äôs rights, lived at 5 Franklin Place with her family as a young woman. Among her many achievements, May succeeded in starting a separate Latin School for girls and served as one of the first women on the Boston School Committee.",

            "Comments": "A former well-known residence for working women and students, the Franklin Square House provided decent and safe housing for Boston women for more than forty years in the mid twentieth century. In addition to individual rooms, the building had a ballroom on the first floor edged with curtained cubicles with couches, where the women could entertain their guests. A cafeteria provided breakfast, dinner, and box lunches. The Blue Goose restaurant on the main floor was open to the public.<br>Constructed as the St. James Hotel in 1868, the largest in Boston and able to accommodate 500 guests, the building became the New England Conservatory of Music in 1882. In 1902 the Rev. George L. Perin, minister of the Shawmut Avenue Universalist Church, organized a corporation to purchase it as a self-supporting residence for women. In the early 1970s it was converted to elderly housing.",

            "Comments": "In 1949, social workers Otto P. and Muriel S. Snowden founded Freedom House at 151 Humboldt Street in Roxbury. The goal was to create an interracial, interfaith center to fight for neighborhood improvement, better schools, and racial cooperation. In 1952, Freedom House moved to 14 Crawford Street in Grove Hall, although a devastating fire forced it to its “new” facility at 5 Crawford Street in 1961. Since then, Freedom House has been the site of countless political and civil rights struggles, including the fight for “racially balanced” public schools in the 1960s and 1970s.",

The Crusaders rented a brownstone on Holyoke Street until 1909 when member Julia O. Henson donated her own townhouse at 25 Holyoke Street as a permanent headquarters for the organization‚Äôs expanding programs. Harriet Tubman visited Boston several times in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, often staying with Julia Henson at this site. In 1960, the Harriet Tubman House merged with other settlement houses in the area to form the United South End Settlements (USES) and in 1976 USES erected a modern building at the corner of Columbus and Massachusetts Avenues.",

            "Comments": "Dedicated at a community-wide celebration on June 20, 1999, these two powerful statues by African American women sculptors stand as a testament to the African American drive for freedom. Although Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller (1877-1968) completed Emancipation in 1913 on the fiftieth anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, it was not cast in bronze until it was selected to be placed at Harriet Tubman Square. Instead of showing the paternalism of a white president freeing enslaved people, Fuller presented the freedman and freedwoman as active agents moving out of slavery into the world. Fuller was a community activist herself in addition to being a sculptor. She married Solomon Carter Fuller, America‚Äôs first African American psychiatrist in 1909.<br>In Step on Board, Boston-based Fern Cunningham shows both the power and compassion of Harriet Tubman (1822-1913), the most famous ‚Äúconductor‚Äù on the Underground Railroad. Among Cunningham‚Äôs other public sculptures in Boston are Earth Challengers at the Joseph Lee School in Dorchester and Sentinel in the Forest Hills Cemetery.",

In 1848 she disguised herself as her master, bandaged as if ill, and tended to by her husband as if he were the slave. They escaped from Georgia by taking the train and steamer to Boston. After two years in Boston where they were active in the anti-slavery cause, they sailed to England, staying until after the Civil War because the new Fugitive Slave Law endangered their lives. Harriet Hayden (ca. 1816-93) and her husband, Lewis Hayden, both born slaves, owned this house for more than forty years. They worked with Underground Railroad ‚Äúconductor‚Äù Harriet Tubman (ca. 1820-1913), known as the ‚ÄúMoses of her People,‚Äù in moving slaves to safe havens . Harriet Hayden bequeathed a scholarship for ‚Äúneedy and worthy colored students‚Äù at Harvard Medical School.",

Swan was one of the five original members of the Mount Vernon proprietors whose goal was to transform Beacon Hill into a fashionable neighborhood. She built the three row houses at numbers 13, 15, 17 for her daughters and another for herself at number 16. Her collection of French furnishings is now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, as are several of the family portraits she commissioned Gilbert Stuart to paint.<br>Julia Ward HoweJulia Ward Howe, who is best known as the author of The Battle Hymn of the Republic written at the beginning of the Civil War, lived at 13 Chestnut during that period, one of her several residences in Boston. Howe was a noted reformer and early participant in the women‚Äôs club movement after the war. She was joined by a group of women, including Caroline Severance (1820-1914), in founding the New England Women‚Äôs Club in 1868, one of the first women‚Äôs clubs in the country. Howe was a leader in the woman suffrage movement and helped found the Woman‚Äôs Journal. Howe read papers at the meetings of the Radical Club, a club for women and men who were ‚Äúdaring thinkers‚Äù which often met at this site. In 1879, three years after her husband‚Äôs death, moved to 241 Beacon Street.",

She began her career as a concert pianist, but after her marriage to Dr. Henry Harris Beach, she turned her talents to composition. When her Mass in E flat major, which took three years to complete, was performed by the Handel and Haydn Society with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in February 1892, it was the first work by a woman to be performed by the Society. In the same year her aria for an alto soloist was the first work by a woman to be performed by the New York Symphony Orchestra. Her standing as a composer led her to be commissioned to write the Festival Jubilate for chorus and orchestra which was played at the dedication of the Woman’s Building during Chicago’s 1892 World’s Columbia Exposition. Beach’s Gaelic Symphony was performed by orchestras throughout the country. In 1900, she premiered her own piano concerto with the Boston Symphony and later performed it in Europe. In addition to her larger pieces, Beach composed choral works, piano pieces, and over 150 popular songs.",

Her twenty-five works of fiction were set both in historical and modern times and dealt with making ethical decisions in different settings. Although she considered herself a ‚Äúnew woman‚Äù determined to preserve her freedom of action, she did not support woman suffrage. Her charity was personal; she took young unwed mothers into her home until they could become self-supporting, believing that their love for their babies would provide an incentive.",

After the war, she opened a school for African American children in Savannah, Georgia. After the death of her husband, she came north as a cook and settled in Boston before remarrying. In 1886, she helped organize Corps 67 of the Women‚Äôs Relief Corps, an auxiliary to the GAR that served veterans, and became its president in 1893.

It honors the arrival of Irish immigrants to Boston and their contributions to the city. Created by sculptor Robert Shure, the sculptures depict a starving family in Ireland begging for help, and one arriving in America. Among the Irish women honored by the Boston Women's Heritage Trail is Annie Sullivan Macy (1866-1936), known as the gifted teacher of Helen Keller (1880-1968). Born to poor Irish immigrants to Massachusetts, Sullivan progressively became blind. After the death of her mother and her father's abandonment, she entered an orphanage. In 1880, a supervisor placed her in the Perkins School for the Blind in South Boston. Two operations improved her eyesight enough so she could read, and Sullivan graduated as valedictorian of her class. She became the teacher of Helen Keller, who came from an advantaged family but could not hear, see, or speak. Sullivan devoted her life to Keller, who became a national celebrity, and saw Keller through her education and early career.",

In 1977, amidst the struggle to desegregate Boston Public Schools, O’Bryant became the first African American elected to the Boston School Committee in the 20th Century. The John D. O’Bryant School of Mathematics and Science has carried its namesake’s commitment to public education into the twenty first century from its roots as Boston’s Mechanic Arts High School (est. 1893). From 1944, when the school changed its name to Boston Technical High School through its collaboration with Mario Umana Technical High School in 1989, John D. O’Bryant has educated generations of young people across Roxbury.",

            "Comments": "Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin (1842-1924), African American editor and publisher of The Woman‚Äôs Era, the journal of the New Era Club, lived here for two decades. She founded the club for African American women in 1894. A year later, she organized a national conference to form the National Federation of Afro-American Women to show the existence of a ‚Äúlarge and growing class‚Äù of cultured African American women. They met at the Charles Street A.M.E. Church (now Charles Street Meeting House) and merged with the Colored Women‚Äôs League to form the National Association of Colored Women in 1896. Ruffin served as the first vice president. Although it was accepted by the Massachusetts State Federation of Womens‚Äô Clubs, the New Era Club was refused membership in the national federation in 1900 for fear of offending Southern members.<br>Florida Ruffin Ridley (1861-1943), Ruffin‚Äôs daughter, became the second African American teacher in the Boston Public Schools. She was active with her mother in the New Era Club as well as in the League of Women for Community Service. She also became a member of several predominantly white clubs, including the Twentieth Century Club and the Women‚Äôs City Club of Boston. In addition to her work as a club woman and civil rights activist, Ridley was an essayist and journalist, focusing much of her writing on race relations in New England. In the 1920s, her interest in history led her to found the Society of the Descendants of Early New England Negroes. Through this work, she hoped to connect an understanding of history with contemporary work for social justice. African Americans and whites have always been involved, she wrote, ‚Äúin the eternal war for justice and liberty which the state has waged.‚Äù Then, as in her own time, she believed both races deserved an equal place in society.",

            "Comments": "When the Arab American community moved from South Cove to the South End, the women also moved the headquarters of the Lebanese-Syrian Ladies‚Äô Aid Society to 44 West Newton Street (see C9). Although the society continued its mission of providing aid and scholarships to the Arab American community, its mix of ages created an extended family. According to its historian, Evelyn Shakir, it served as a ‚Äúbenevolent matriarchy‚Äù for the young women who worked in the shops or attended nearby Girls‚Äô High School.<br>Among the Arab American women who were the first to teach in the Boston Public Schools were art teacher Labeebee Hanna Saquet (1904‚Äì97) and media specialist Evelyn Abdalah Menconi (1919‚Äì2003). Both woman served as bridges between Arab Americans and the general public, beginning in 1930 when Saquet directed Arabian Nights, a Boston Syrian Tercentenary celebration presented at Symphony Hall. Menconi worked with Shakir on the Arabic Hour television program and was the curator of the William A. Abdalah Memorial Library at St. George Orthodox Church in West Roxbury, which offers a Memorial Cultural Series in her name. She wrote Eastern Mediterranean Cooking, and was co-editor of an issue of Cobblestone on Arab Americans.",

            "Comments": "The presence of author Louisa May Alcott (1832-88) in the South End covers many areas and activities. The Louisa May Alcott School was on this site from 1910 until it closed in 1961. A settlement house named the Louisa May Alcott Club, located on 15 Oswego Street north of East Berkeley Street, offered activities to Italian and Jewish immigrants.<br>In addition, Louisa May Alcott herself lived off and on in the South End, both with her family and as an independent woman. As early as 1835, they lived in three locations in the South End, including rooms on Harrison Avenue and Beach Street, before moving to Concord in 1840. By 1848 the family was back, living in a small house on Dedham Street. For a brief time, Louisa assisted her sister Anna B. Alcott (1831-93) who operated a school on Canton Street. In later life, Louisa often spent summers with the family in Concord and winters in Boston; for example, in the winter of 1873 she brought her family to 26 East Brookline Street overlooking Franklin Square. The South End and Concord came together when Louisa rented a quiet room on West Brookline Street for several months in 1868 where she wrote the sequel to Little Women.",

During the 1890s, black Harvard students, including W.E.B. Du Bois, spent time in Baldwin’s personal library, which included works by writers of African descent from around the world. Baldwin helped her friend, the feminist Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin (1842 - 1924) found the National Federation of Afro-American Women in 1895, and co-founded Boston’s League of Women for Community Service in 1919. The Agassiz School was renamed the Maria Baldwin School in 2004.",

More than 4,000 students attended her classes during this period. Eddy also conducted church services in the building. A few years before moving here, the Christian Science Association had voted to organize as a church and ordained her as its pastor. Despite the death of her husband in 1882, she continued to move ahead. Here she published the first issue of the Journal of Christian Science and her sixth edition of Science and Health, which she would continue to revise throughout her life. The religion she founded grew rapidly and in 1895, the ‚ÄúMother Church‚Äù was installed in its first building on Huntington Avenue. The domed building followed in 1906.",

As the first African American elected to the governorship of the Commonwealth, and one of the only popularly elected black governors since Reconstruction, Patrick was born in Chicago, attended Massachusetts’ Milton Academy, Harvard College, and Harvard Law School, and served as U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division under President Bill Clinton (1994 - 1997). As Governor, Patrick oversaw the implementation of Massachusetts’ healthcare reform legislation when the State became the first in the country to mandate universal healthcare for its citizens. This law became the basis for the Federal Affordable Care Act signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.",

A graduate of Boston University‚Äôs Sargent College, she taught physical education at Tuskegee Institute (later University) in Alabama from 1921 to 1932. Later she entered show business. In 1938 she danced her interpretation of African American spirituals with the Boston Pops. She appeared on Broadway with such revues as Blackbirds and Flying Colors and danced with white performers including Imogene Coca and Clifton Webb, virtually unprecedented for an African American dancer in that period. For more than five years she toured in the Chocolate Revue in New York, Baltimore, and Washington, D. C. When she put her dancing career behind her, she served as an officer in the Women‚Äôs Army Corps during World War II. From 1947 to 1968, she worked for the Massachusetts Commission against Discrimination. She also founded the 464 Community Workshop, a fund raising auxiliary of the Women‚Äôs Service Club.",

            "Comments": "During the 1940s, a local group of black musicians organized one of Boston's first Muslim communities of African descent. In 1957, early followers of the Nation of Islam’s Elijah Muhammad established Mosque No. 11 in an old Synagogue on Intervale Street in Dorchester. Malcolm X, who lived in Roxbury with his sister after his release from prison, ministered at Mosque No. 11 and considered it his home. Louis Farrakhan also ministered at the mosque and lived in the adjoining property, 37 Intervale Street. After X’s assassination in 1965, the Mosque, like others across the country, entered a period of transformation. This was in large part due to the fact that in 1976, when Nation of Islam founder, Elijah Muhammad, passed away, his son, Imam Warith Deen Mohammed, declared that all Nation of Islam followers should convert to Al-Islam. Mosque No. 11 made this conversion, and subsequent leaders, including Imam Shakir Mahmoud, renamed the Mosque Masjid Al-Quran. Presently, Mosque 11 Masjid Al-Quran keeps its doors open to the community of 70,000 Muslims who live and worship in Boston, and members come from all over the city.",

Among its former directors was Ruth Batson (1921-2003), a leading civil rights activist in Boston. She was chairperson of the education committee of the Boston NAACP that led the fight in the early 1960s against segregation in the Boston Public Schools and a founder and later director of the METCO voluntary desegregation program.<br>The Abiel Smith School served African American children from 1835 to 1855 until the state legislature passed an act allowing them to attend the school closest to their homes. The change was prompted by the actions of Benjamin Roberts, an African American, who sued the city in 1848 stating that his daughter Sarah Roberts was unlawfully refused entrance to five schools between her home and the Smith School. Although Roberts lost his case despite the help of prominent abolitionists, his actions had the long term effect of opening all Boston Public Schools to African American children.",

            "Comments": "The statue of a Civil War nurse administering aid to a wounded soldier was a gift of the Massachusetts Daughters of Veterans in 1914. They called the nurses ‚'Angels of Mercy and Life Amid Scenes of Conflict and Death'. On the facing balcony wall is a painting honoring mothers of war by Boston artist Edward Brodney. His mother, Sarah Brodney, was the model for the central figure.Two plaques behind the nurse's statue honor two individual wartime nurses: Clara Barton (1821-1912) and Second Lt. Frances Slanger (1913-44). Born in North Oxford, Massachusetts, Clara Barton is best known as the founder of the American Red Cross in 1881. During the Civil War, she administered so much direct aid and provided so many supplies that she became known as the 'Angel of the Battlefield'. She established the first office to coordinate information on missing soldiers. Under her leadership from 1881-1904, the Red Cross provided relief in twenty-one disasters in addition to the Spanish-American War.Frances Slanger was the first American nurse in the European Theater to be killed in combat during World War II. A U.S. Army nurse with the 45th field hospital, she landed in Normandy with the first hospital platoon on June 9, 1944. She is also remembered for the eloquence of a letter she wrote to the Stars and Stripes the day before she died praising the rank and file American GI. At age seven, Slanger emigrated with her family to the U.S. from Lodz, Poland. They settled in the South End where she worked with her father peddling fruits and vegetables while attending school. She graduated from Boston's High School of Practical Arts and the Boston City Hospital School of Nursing.",

            "Comments": "When Old South, the site of mass protest meetings in Revolutionary Boston, was slated for demolition a hundred years later, a group of women bought the building (but not the land) to protect it. Philanthropist Mary Tileston Hemenway (1820-94) then contributed more than half the sum needed to preserve it, becoming an early leader in historic preservation. Phillis Wheatley (ca. 1753-84), the first African American poet to be published in book form, was a member of Old South. While still a child, she was purchased as a slave by the Wheatley family. Her poetry reflects her love of freedom: Should you, wonder from whence my love of Freedom sprung‚ young in life, was snatched from Africa's fancy‚ happy seat‚ such, such my case. And can I then but pray Others may never feel tyrannic sway? Phillis Wheatley is one of three women chosen to be portrayed in the Boston Women's Memorial. An exhibit depicting her life is permanently displayed here.",

            "Comments": "Parkman Bandstand (est. 1912) has been the site of civil rights protests and political rallies by the region's African descended people since 1915, when newspaper editor William Monroe Trotter (1872 - 1934) led at this site the local campaign against D.W. Griffith's racist film \"Birth of a Nation.\" In 2007, America's first African-American president, Barack Obama, held a political rally at the bandstand with Massachusetts' first African-American Governor, Deval Patrick. Most famously, on April 23, 1965, Martin Luther King Jr. spoke from the bandstand to a crowd of over 22,000 people involved in city-wide protests against segregated housing, unequal public schools, and deeply entrenched economic inequality across greater Boston.",

            "Comments": "Portia School of Law began in 1908 when two women who wanted to take the Massachusetts bar examination asked Attorney Arthur W. MacLean to tutor them. His wife, Bertha MacLean, named the nascent school after ‚ÄúPortia‚Äù who disguises herself as a lawyer in Shakespeare‚Äôs Merchant of Venice. The informal school expanded and became the only school providing legal education for women exclusively. In 1920 the first L.L.B. degrees were awarded to thirty-nine women.<br>In 1923, Blanche Woodson Braxton (1894-1939), a graduate of Portia Law in 1921, became the first African American woman to be admitted to the Massachusetts Bar. She later became the first African American woman admitted to practice in the U.S. District Court in the state. The first woman president of the Board of Trustees of New England School of Law was Anna E. Hirsch (1902-97), a 1928 graduate of Portia Law. Hirsch was elected register of probate for Norfolk County in 1954 and 1960.",

            "Comments": "Faneuil Hall and the adjoining Quincy Market are the historic locations of Boston‚Äôs great women‚Äôs fairs and protest meetings. The Anti-Slavery Bazaars, sponsored by the Female Anti-Slavery Societies, were held there in the 1830s and 1840s. In September 1840, women held a seven-day fair to raise money to complete the building of the Bunker Hill monument. Inspired by Sarah Josepha Hale (1820-79), the women raised $30,000. Among the women‚Äôs suffrage meetings held in Faneuil Hall was a New England Woman‚Äôs Tea Party, sponsored on the centennial of the Boston Tea Party by the New England Woman Suffrage Association. They invited the public to join them in the celebration, noting that women were still subject to ‚Äútaxation without representation.‚Äù In an alcove behind the stage, note the bust of Lucy Stone, a main speaker at the Tea Party. Suzette LaFlesheSuzette ‚ÄúBright Eyes‚Äù LaFleshe (1854-1903), an Omaha Indian, inspired the Indian Rights Movement when she spoke in Faneuil Hall in December 1879. LaFlesche, wearing native dress and a bear-claw necklace, protested the reservation system: ‚ÄúDid our Creator‚Ä¶intend that men created in his own image should be ruled over by another set of his creatures?‚Äù After hearing Bright Eyes speak in Boston, many Boston women became her supporters. Helen Hunt Jackson (1830-85) was inspired by her speech to write A Century of Dishonor, a book that cited injustices to the Indian peoples, and works of fiction about Native Americans including Ramona. Working women saw Faneuil Hall as a place for a forum for their demands. In 1903, the Women‚Äôs Trade Union League was founded in Faneuil Hall. Massachusetts nurses also chose the hall to rally for professional status in 1903 when they founded the Massachusetts Nurses Association. Among the organizers was Lucy Lincoln Drown (1847-1934), superintendent of nurses at Boston City Hospital from 1885 to 1910. In 1919, the call for the women telephone operators‚Äô strike brought two thousand angry women to the hall.",

            "Comments": "The Boston Normal School, designed to train women teachers for the Boston Public Schools, became a separate entity when it moved from Girls‚Äô High to the top floors of the Rice School in 1876. Founded in 1852, the two-year normal course trained women to be assistants to male masters in primary and grammar schools. When the Normal School moved to the Rice School, women were required to be high school graduates and the course was one year, becoming two years in 1892. Women assistants taught in the two training schools: a boys‚Äô grammar school in the Rice School and a mixed primary school, the Appleton Street School (later the Bancroft School). By the time Boston Normal was renamed Boston Teachers College in 1922, it had its own building on Huntington Avenue and, in 1925, a four-year program. In 1952 the Teachers College became part of the state college system and, as Boston State College, merged with the University of Massachusetts at Boston in 1965.",

            "Comments": "For most of the early twentieth century, Mattapan was a predominantly Jewish neighborhood at the southern edge of Dorchester. During the late 1960s and 1970s, due in part to Boston Banks Urban Renewal Group (B-BURG), redlining and blockbusting led to white flight from the area. Mattapan’s black community grew during the 1970s, and since the 1980s, Mattapan has been home to an increasingly ethnically diverse black community, including especially immigrants from Haiti and the Caribbean. This 2005 sculpture, designed by former Mattapan residents and cousins Fern Cunningham and Karen Eutemey, serves as a gateway to Mattapan. The pair of nineteen foot statues celebrate the diverse history of Mattapan, including its Native American (Mattahunt), Jewish, German, Irish, African-American and Caribbean origins.",

Caesar Robbins (b. 1745), the family patriarch, was enslaved in Chelmsford and served in both the French and Indian, and the Revolutionary War. Two of his six children, Susan and Peter, were the first residents of the house. His granddaughter, Ellen Garrison Jackson, was born in the house in 1823, supported abolitionist and women’s rights in Boston, and worked as a teacher in Freedmen’s Schools in the U.S. South during the early days of Reconstruction.",

            "Comments": "Roland Hayes (1887 - 1977) was the first African-American artist to perform as a vocal soloist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Born in Curryville, Georgia in 1887, Roland Hayes was the son of formerly enslaved parents, Fanny and William Hayes. Roland was a singer as a child, and studied music at Fisk University, where he performed with the Fisk Jubilee Singers. After touring the world, including in London where King George and Queen Mary of England requested that he perform for them privately, Hayes returned to the United States and married Helen A. Mann. He settled in Boston in 1911, and later taught at Boston University. After receiving many awards and honors, including the 1924 NAACP Springarn Medal, Hayes performed for the final time at the Longy School of Music in Cambridge in 1973. He died in 1977 in Boston and is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery.",

McGuire (1866 - 1934) founded the African Orthodox Church (AOC) in 1921, upon appointment as Bishop by the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). Located at this site in Cambridge, St. Augustine’s Church held AOC services that supported the pan-Africanist philosophy of Marcus Garvey. McGuire had moved to the area in the early 1900s to study medicine at the Boston College of Physicians and Surgeons. Although McGuire was ordained in the Episcopal Church, soon after his arrival in the U.S., he became disenchanted with the racism of the predominantly white denomination and founded the predominantly West Indian St. Bartholomew’s Church in Cambridge, MA. Although the relationship between McGuire and Garvey ultimately ended in the 1920s, McGuire continued to lead local African descended people, both West Indian and native born, as the AOC expanded to thirty churches, fifty clergy, and 30,000 members across the Americas and Africa.",

In 1853, Remond bought a ticket for the opera, Don Pasquale, at the Howard Athenaeum in Boston. When she refused to accept segregated seating, she was forced to leave the theatre and pushed down some stairs. Remond sued for damages and won her case. She was awarded $500, gaining an admission that she was wronged. Remond went on to become an international anti-slavery lecturer.",

            "Comments": "Boston‚Äôs settlement house movement was one of the earliest in the country. Patterned after Toynbee Hall in London‚Äôs East End where university graduates lived or ‚Äúsettled‚Äù within the disadvantaged communities they hoped to serve, the movement in America was a response to the consequences of immigration, industrialization, and urbanization. Initiated in Boston by Robert A. Woods as Head Resident in 1891, the South End House had many locations in the South End and Lower Roxbury and included women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs residences (see SE31). College women in Boston also founded their own settlement house, Denison House. The present South End House is the home to the youth programs of the United South End Settlements. Its newly renovated building was built in 1840 by the Children‚Äôs Friend Society as a home for orphaned children. Among its recent social workers was Gladys Gusson (1935‚Äì88) who counseled families, was a tenant advocate, and ran after-school groups and girls‚Äô clubs.<br>Long-time activist and Dominican community leader Frieda Garcia was Executive Director of USES from 1981 to 2001. A portrait of her hangs inside this building. She was the first director of La Alianza Hispana, a community based nonprofit organization providing a wide range of services to Latino families, founded by Ana Maria Rodriquez, a Boston teacher.<br><br>The Children‚Äôs Art Centre, incorporated in 1914 and built in 1918, was the first fine arts museum for children in the country. The Centre offers a wide range of art and music for children under the sponsorship of the USES. Another South End institution, the Community Music Center of Boston at the Boston Center for the Arts, was founded in 1910 by Annie Endicott Nourse (1878‚Äì1965), a piano teacher.",

The congregation was established in 1910 after recent migrants from Barbados and Jamaica faced discrimination from local white Episcopalians; it met in several temporary locations before congregants purchased their own site for worship in 1921. Although congregants were primarily from the Caribbean, the church also served African Americans and foreign born people of African descent. Services began in the building in 1924; the congregation was named after Cyprian, the Bishop of Carthage in North Africa.",

            "Comments": "Originally founded in Sussex, England, in 1855 to care for the poor and ill in the surrounding countryside, this Episcopalian religious community came to Boston in 1873 to act as superintendents of a children‚Äôs hospital. The sisters moved to three townhouses on Louisburg Square in 1883 which they used as a convent, chapel, and small hospital. Here, they expanded their nursing and evangelical teachings to reach the sick and poor on Beacon Hill and its environs. They ran St. Monica‚Äôs Home, a nursing home for Black women and children, on Joy Street and later in Roxbury until 1988. In 2012, the St. Margaret‚Äôs Community moved the Motherhouse to Duxbury although the Sisters continue to have a presence in Boston. Several Sisters live in a small residence in the city and maintain urban ministries with St. Stephens church in the South End and the Be Safe program. Additionally, there are mission houses in New York City (Manhattan) and Port-au-Prince, Haiti.",

            "Comments": "Susanna Haswell Rowson (1760-1824), a playwright and an actress at the Federal Street Theatre, was the author of the first American best-selling novel, Charlotte Temple, A Tale of Truth. Rowson arrived in America when she was six, but her father was a Loyalist and during the Revolution they returned to England. Not long after her marriage to William Rowson, Susanna returned to America and settled in Boston where they both acted at the Federal Street Theatre. For the five years following 1796, she performed 129 different parts in 126 productions, many of which she wrote herself. Her next venture was to set up a Young Ladies Academy in 1797 near the Theatre. Rowson moved the school out of Boston but later returned. Her academy was one of the first to offer girls education above the elementary level and included instruction in music and public speaking.Another woman playwright whose plays were performed at the Federal Street Theatre in 1795 and 1796 was Judith Sargent Murray. Her satirical plays, The Medium or Happy Tea-Party (later renamed The Medium, or Virtue Triumphant) and The Traveller Returned, addressed class structure and gender roles in the New Republic.Public speakers lecturing at the Federal Street Theatre included Deborah Sampson (1760-1827), considered to be America's first female soldier. In 1802, Sampson electrified the crowd as she told her story of fighting in the Revolutionary War for eighteen months disguised as a man named Robert Shurtleff.",

The Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) planned to transform a lot that had been cleared by the city into a parking garage; as many as 100 families were displaced in the initial clearing and there was still great need for affordable housing in the working-class, predominantly black neighborhood. The Tent City occupation attracted support from activists and celebrities, including Celtics player and coach, Bill Russell, who fed the activists as they set up small tents on the lot. Despite multiple arrests, organizers formed the Tent City Task Force (later named the Tent City Corporation), which eventually forced the city to create the Tent City Housing Complex in 1988. Presently, the Tent City Housing Complex is a mixed income development.",

Poet and celebrity Amy Lowell (1874-1925) was the first woman to be appointed to the Board of Directors. As a girl, Lowell had free run of the Athenæum. In 1903 when the trustees threatened to tear down the building, Amy Lowell led the protest. Her poetry flourished when, during a sojourn in Paris, she discovered French symbolism as expressed in the branch of poetry called \"Imagism\". She edited works of poetry, as well as bringing out collections of her own work.The Athenæum's art collection includes: Puck and Owl, a sculpture by Harriet Hosmer (1830-1908) ; a portrait of Hannah Adams (1755-1831), a scholar and author who was the first woman to be given reading privileges at the library; and a portrait by John Singer Sargent of Annie Adams Fields (1834-1915).

In 2002 in her honor, the city renamed the school the Baldwin School.

The school she founded in 1950 provided arts education for black and brown children across Roxbury and the South End. In 1968, she created the National Center of Afro-American Artists as an institution committed to preserving and fostering the cultural arts heritage of black peoples worldwide. The adjoining museum, which was established at a later date, is dedicated to the celebration, exhibition, collection, and criticism of black visual arts heritage worldwide. The center currently operates the Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists which displays and supports work by artists across the global African diaspora.",

The Memorial was dedicated in October 1995 to foster the memory of, and reflection on, one of the great tragedies of modern times. The Memorial features six luminous glass towers etched with six million numbers to remind visitors of those who perished during the Holocaust, or Shoah, from 1933-45. In total, the Memorial honors all eleven million people who perished because of their race, religion, nationality, physical disability or sexual preference, as well as those who courageously aided death camp survivors. The Memorial‚Äôs dedication includes the words,know that wherever prejudice, discrimination and victimization are tolerated, evil like the Holocaust can happen again.",

            "Comments": "The Public Garden opened in 1837 as a private space, but grew into a public park with its lagoon, swan boats, seasonal plantings, fountains, and sculpture. Make Way for Ducklings, modeled on the ducklings in Robert McCloskey’s book of the same name, is by local sculptor, Nancy Schön. Women also designed the sculptures for four fountains in the Public Garden. Beginning with the ducklings, follow the path to the left to Triton Babies by Anna Coleman Ladd (1878-1939), given by Elizabeth Sturgis Grew Beal. Continue to Bagheera by Lillian Swann Saarinen. Named for the panther in Rudyard Kipling’s Jungle Book, it was given to the garden by friends of the sculptor. Cross the bridge over the lagoon to the Arlington Street entrance. On your right is Small Child by Mary Moore (1881-1967), the gift of Margaret Tenney Tozzer. On your left is Boy and Bird by Bashka Paeff (1893-1979), a Russian immigrant who studied at the Museum School and gave the sculpture to the Public Garden. Note: Thomas Ball’s sculpture of Charles Sumner. Although Anne Whitney’s model won the blind competition, the Boston Arts committee rejected it when they learned that the sculptor was a woman, choosing Ball’s instead. Whitney later installed her version in Harvard Square in 1902.",

            "Comments": "The Vilna Shul was built in 1919 to serve the Jewish community on Beacon Hill as a synagogue and community center. Although it closed in 1985, the building has been restored as a Jewish cultural<br>center. Before they built the synagogue, the congregation of Lithuanian Jews worshipped in temporary spaces for nearly twenty-five years. They named the synagogue for the city of Vilnius, because they considered it to be the center of Jewish culture in Lithuania. Many of the original members of the congregation emigrated from Vilnius where there was a large and thriving Jewish community. Only a few decades later it was destroyed by the Holocaust.The names of the women who were among the founding members of the synagogue are listed in a plaque in the back of the sanctuary. Although the entire congregation sat on the same level, the women‚Äôs section was separate from the men‚Äôs section but equal in size (which was typical of synagogues of that time). The Vilna Shul is also a significant site because it represents the large Jewish community who made their first Boston homes in the old West End and on the north slope of Beacon Hill.",

            "Comments": "The Women‚Äôs Service Club began as one of Mrs. Wilson‚Äôs knitting clubs, organized by Mary Evans Wilson (1866‚Äì1928), when, during World War 1, members met to knit scarves and gloves for soldiers. Wilson and her husband, Attorney Butler Wilson, were organizers of the Boston branch of the NAACP, which had the largest membership in the national organization during its first decade, 1909‚Äì20. Mary Evans Wilson traveled throughout the northeast recruiting members for the NAACP. In Boston her knitting clubs produced 300 new women members. In 1919, the club, by then called the Women‚Äôs Service Club, purchased this building and incorporated with a goal of providing service programs for the African American community. Among the club‚Äôs former presidents was Harriet Hall (1890‚Äì1975), who co-founded the interracial Women‚Äôs Republican Club on Beacon Hill in 1920. As president of WSC, she spearheaded the WSC‚Äôs drive to allow African Americans to live in dormitories of local educational institutions. Melnea Cass (1896‚Äì1978) served as president for more than fifteen years. Cass initiated the Homemakers Training Program which certified domestic workers so they would be assured social security and other benefits. She worked to open employment for African Americans in stores and hospitals, helped found Freedom House, was president of the Boston NAACP, and a charter member of the anti-poverty agency ABCD. Known as the ‚ÄúFirst Lady of Roxbury,‚Äù Melnea Cass is honored by having the Boston YWCA on Clarendon Street named for her.",

            "Comments": "In an earlier building on this site, nineteenth century women held many meetings urging the abolition of slavery, adoption of woman suffrage, and temperance reform. Mary Rice Livermore (1820-1905) was a prominent national lecturer after the Civil War who often spoke at Tremont Temple. Her first speech there was in 1869 when her subject was woman suffrage. Her Boston speeches in 1874 led to the founding of the Massachusetts Women‚Äôs Christian Temperance Union for which she served as president for ten years. Livermore was the first editor of the Woman's Journal. She later held the office of president of the American Woman's Suffrage Association and was first president of the Association for the Advancement of Women. Here, in March 1885, Mary Baker Eddy (1821-1910), founder of the Church of Christ, Scientist, was given ten minutes to respond to a barrage of criticism from members of the Boston clergy. Her ideas about God as father-mother and of man and woman as co-equals, both created in God‚Äôs image‚ angered the ministers of the time. Her book, Science and Health, was a best seller. In the years following her talk, Eddy emerged as one of the most important women reformers of her day, pioneering in the field of mind-body medicine. Soon after she spoke in Tremont Temple, she wrote\"Let it not be heard in Boston that woman‚ has no rights which man is bound to respect.This is woman's hour, with all its sweet amenities and its moral and religious reforms.",

Griffiths’ \"Birth of a Nation,\" the popular film that glorified the southern Ku Klux Klan. During the protests, many black activists, including Trotter, were arrested after the city’s Mayor, James Michael Curley (1874 - 1958), initially refused to censor the film. Trotter’s public protest inspired similar NAACP-led demonstrations across the country.",

In the decades before the Civil War, the congregation was known as the “Fugitive Slaves’ Church” for its support of enslaved men and women. Some of the more famous fugitives who used the Twelfth Baptist on their escape to freedom were William and Ellen Craft, Shadrach Minkins, and Thomas Sims.",

The church, which has had four locations, originated as an African American church in 1818 on the north side of Beacon Hill. When the church was located in Lower Roxbury in 1916, the Women‚Äôs Home Missionary Society, under the leadership of Hattie B. Cooper (1862‚Äì1949), provided services for the growing population of African Americans in that area. The church continued these services in Lower Roxbury and now houses them in the Hattie B. Cooper Community Center which opened in 1975.",

            "Comments": "The offices of the Woman's Journal, the newspaper published by the American Woman Suffrage Association, and the New England Women's Club, one of the first clubs for women in the country, were in another building on this site. Edited by Lucy Stone (1818-93), the Journal chose office space as close to the seat of power‚ the State House‚ as possible. Stone petitioned annually for woman suffrage. Stone had been one of the first Massachusetts women to receive a college degree when she graduated from Oberlin College in 1847. When she married Henry Blackwell she became the first married woman to officially keep her maiden name, leading to the late nineteenth-century coining of the term ‚'a Lucy Stoner' to mean a woman who stood up for her rights. Lucy Stone is one of three women chosen to be portrayed in the Boston Women's Memorial and one of six to be memorialized in the State House. Alice Stone Blackwell (1857-1950), Stone's daughter, edited the Journal in a building on Copley Square for twenty-five years until suffrage was granted in 1920. In 1973, a trade union for women office workers named 9 to 5 held its first monthly meetings in this building now owned by the Paulist Fathers. A member decided to organize after her boss walked into the office and said, ‚ÄúWell, I guess there's no one here. The Boston chapter of 9 to 5 is now part of District 925 of of the Services International Employees Union.",

            "Comments": "Jennie Loitman Barron (1891-1969) became the state's first full-time woman judge in 1934. She served for thirty years, twenty in the Boston Municipal Court and ten in the Superior Court. As a lawyer representing the League of Women Voters, she successfully argued for women‚Äôs service on juries. Before she became a judge, Barron served on the Boston School Committee in the late 1920s, where she focused attention on substandard school conditions.",
